    <h3>Description -</h3>
    <p>This rotisserie chicken recipe is so easy to make with simple seasonings on your grill. Occasional basting with a butter mixture ensures crispy skin and moist meat. Our family loves this! Rotisserie chicken is perfect as the main dish with French fries and coleslaw, or with any number of other sides.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients -</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Chicken: This recipe is meant for a whole 3-pound chicken. If your chicken is larger or smaller, you'll have to adjust the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter keeps the chicken moist and juicy, while giving the seasonings something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The rotisserie chicken is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps -</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Pull one of the legs away from the body and slice through the meat until the hip bone is exposed. Then, pull the leg harder until the leg is detached.</li>
        <li>Use your knife to separate the drumstick and thigh.</li>
        <li>Pull the wing tip away from the breast until you can easily cut through the joint.</li>
        <li>Slice one of the breasts away from the breastbone. Repeat with the other breast.</li>
    </ol>
